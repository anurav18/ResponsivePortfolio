## Project Wherebabouts

The Main adgenda of this project is to start creating a responsive portfolio, which will be used as an interaction to the external users where they can communicate with us eventually, It will have a breif overview on past experience, It also has a portfolio page which has a photo gallery listing all the previous achievements and special events. The ultimate goal is to build all these pages using the capabilities and functionalities available in bootstrap library. It is also very important to build these pages using HTML semantics.
These three pages should have a responsive capability to adapt to the changes in the screen sizes. So we need to build this site in a such a way that it fits right in xs-screen (For Mobiles), for sm-screen (For Tablets) and for md-screen (Regular Desktops). Every html page has a Nav bar which has navigation links to all the other pages and the active link is turned to black on the navigation bar.

## About Me Page

This page has the brief overview of my career intrests and my future goals I would like to achieve, This page was built using Bootstrap Classes and used some custom styles to change the look and feel of the site. It has three different modes of display included in it.

### About Me xs-screen

Below is the screenshot attched for xs-400 of About Me Page, The About Me container would align in the centre and the nav bar is also collapsed into a toggle
